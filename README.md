Star Evolution

Star age calculator and star cycle android application.

For particles moving at speeds close to or equal to the speed of light, their behavior is discussed separately in the special theory of relativity. In this topic it can be said that the gain or loss of energy of an object can also be seen as gain or loss of its mass. This concept can be used to calculate the age of a star in terms of its relativistic energy.

The calculator to be made is an exponential calculator. The star age calculator system will use radiation intensity, star distance and star mass as input. The output generated from the calculator is the rate of reduction of the sun's mass in kg/s and the age of the star in seconds, days and years.

The simulation system for the stages of star evolution is made based on the results of studies related to star evolution. The simulation in the application will display images and text that will function interactively according to the wishes of the user.

Android application is only available in Bahasa.
